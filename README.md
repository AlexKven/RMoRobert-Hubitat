# LightsOnMotionPlus3
Designed for Hubitat (previous version for SmartThings), the "Lights on Motion Plus" app, was intended to recreate and add additional featueres (e.g., remembering on/off states for a group of lights when motion stops and restoring it when motion resumes, rather than turning all back on) compared to stock light/motion apps.

Lights on Motion Plus 3 aims to re-create this functionality while also trakcing indivudal bulb states as they change, possibly via other means, rather than only saving the state before dimming. This way, if all bulbs are turned off before the app is configured to dim or turn them off, the previous state when at least one bulb was on will be restored (rather than all being turned back on).
