	"releaseNotes": "LoMP 5.3: Added option to run Rule Machine rule actions when LoMP turns off or dims lights; fixed incorrect inactivity (off/dim) delay time calculation.\n\nLoMP 5.2.4: All sensors (\"turn on\" and \"keep on\") now trigger \"on\" action during grace period.\nLoMP 5.2.3: Fixed issue where UI may error if kill switches not set\nLoMP 5.2.2: Fixed \"Turn on and set level\" not honoring \"send on() after setLevel()\" preference (for prestaging)\n\nLoMP 5.2.1: Added option to use on or off state for kill switches (instead of just on).\n\nLoMP 5.2: Per-mode dim/off delay options added; new \"grace period\" option (can turn lights back on if recently turned off, regardless of \"on\" settings); bugfix for lights not turning on in some cases without \"Capture\" option enabled.\n\nLoMP 5.1: Light states restored even if non-dimming \"inactive\" action configured (in case other modes are different); fixed bug with scenes not being activated if \"off only\" inactive action configured\n\nLoMP 5.0.5 and 5.0.4: Various additional ifixes for lights not turning on in some situations\n\nLoMP 5.0.3: Fix for occasional issue where lights get stuck in 'dimmed' state and LoMP tries to restore\n\nLoMP 5.0.2: Minor bugfix for 'don't perform 'on' action if already on' setting being ignored in most cases.\n\nLoMP 5.0.1: Minor bugfix for per-mode dim-to level exceptions.\n\nLoMP 5.0 is a complete rewrite.
