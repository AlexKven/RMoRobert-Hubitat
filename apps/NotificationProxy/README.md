# Notification Proxy

This app is meant to be used in conjunction with the Notification Proxy driver. To use, create a virtual device using the Notification Proxy Driver. Then, create an instance of this app and select the virtual "proxy" device you created as well as the "real" devices you wish to send notifications to by way of the proxy. This is useful if you have multiple Hubitat Mobile App Devices and want notifications to go to all of them without having to choose each one in every automation, or if you frequently swap out devices and don't want to have to change all your automations (just settings in this app) when you do.
