# Dimmer Button Controller

This app is designed to be used to used with button devices and makes it easy to configure each button to turn on/off and/or set level of certain bulbs or to dim/brighten bulbs with button presses as specified. It was specifically created with the goal of emulating a Hue Dimmer (as it behaves when paired to Hue) with a Pico 5-button remote paired to Hubitat with the "fast" (press/release, not press/hold) driver, though it should work for any compatible button device.
