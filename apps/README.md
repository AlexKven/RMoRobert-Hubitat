# LightsOnMotionPlus3
Designed for Hubitat (previous version for SmartThings), the "Lights on Motion Plus" app was intended to recreate and add additional featueres (e.g., remembering on/off states for a group of lights when motion stops and restoring it when motion resumes, rather than turning all back on) compared to stock light/motion apps. This is useful if, for example, you want all bulbs in a room to turn off when motion stops but don't always want all to turn on when motion starts.

Lights on Motion Plus also supports dimming the bulbs before turning them off to "warn" occupants. Lights will be restored to previous states if motion resumes.
