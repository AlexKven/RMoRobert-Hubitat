# Thermostat Run Delay

## Description:
Adjusts thermostat up (in cooling mode) or down (in heating mode) if thermostat temperature approaches thermostat setpoint during certain days/times, as configured in app settings.

## Example use:
Suppose you normally wake up at 7:00 AM in the winter, and you live where it is cold and the furance will occasionally run overnight. Suppose that sometimes your thermostat runs and turns off *just* before you would get out of bed, but you'd prefer it if it were still running, making you feel warmer, *when* you got out of bed instead. This app can help adjust your thermostat setpoint during certain times if the temperature nears that setpoint in order to encourage that to happen.
